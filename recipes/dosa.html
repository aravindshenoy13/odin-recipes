    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>First take all the ingredients in three bowls.
            <ul>
                <li>1.5 cups idli rice or parboiled rice in one bowl. You can also use regular short-grained to medium-grained rice like sona masuri or parmal.</li>
                <li>½ cup urad dal (husked black gram) + 1 tablespoon chana dal (husked and split bengal gram) + 20 methi seeds (fenugreek seeds) in a second bowl</li>
                <li>⅓ cup thick poha (flattened rice) in a third bowl.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Rinse the lentils and fenugreek seeds a couple of times. Then soak them in 1 cup water for 4 to 5 hours.</li>
        <li>Rinse the rice a couple of times and keep aside.</li>
        <li>Rinse flattened rice once or twice and then add to the rice.</li>
        <li>Pour 2 cups water. Stir and soak both rice and flattened rice together for 4 to 5 hours.</li>
        <li>Before grinding, strain the water from the soaked lentils+fenugreek seeds and keep it for grinding urad dal. You can also use fresh water if you prefer.</li>
        <li>Add the lentils in the grinder jar. Also add ½ cup of the soaked and strained water to the lentils or ½ cup of fresh water if you like.</li>
        <li>Grind the urad dal, chana dal and fenugreek seeds till you get a batter which is light and fluffy. The urad dal has to be ground really well, so that the dosa batter ferments well.</li>
        <li>Remove batter in a bowl or pan with a spatula. Below is a photo showing the consistency of the urad dal batter.</li>
        <li>Strain the rice well. Then in the same grinder, add the soaked rice and 1 cup fresh water. You can grind rice in one batch or in two to three batches. This will depend on the size of the grinder jar.</li>
        <li>Grind the rice till you get a fine grainy consistency in it. The rice batter should have a fine rava (cream of wheat) like consistency of the ground rice grains.</li>
        <li>Now pour the rice+flattened rice batter in the same pan or bowl containing the urad lentil batter.</li>
        <li>Add ½ teaspoon edible rock salt or add as per taste. You can also use sea salt or pink salt.</li>
        <li>Mix the salt very well with the ground batter. Also, mix both the rice batter and the urad lentil batter thoroughly. Cover with a lid and keep aside to ferment for 8 to 9 hours at room temperature.</li>
        <li>Rinse and then boil 4 medium sized potatoes in 2 cups water for 5 to 6 whistles in a pressure cooker.</li>
        <li>When the potatoes are cooking, rinse and soak 1 tablespoon chana dal in ¼ cup hot water for 30 minutes. Then drain all the water from the chana dal and set aside.</li>
        <li>When the pressure settles down on its own in the cooker, remove the lid. Drain the potatoes and let them become warm.</li>
        <li>Then peel and chop them. Also, thinly slice 2 medium to large onions (200 grams) and chop 1 to 2 green chilies, finely chop 1 inch ginger and some coriander leaves.</li>
        <li>Heat oil or ghee in a frying pan or skillet. If using cashews, then fry 2 tablespoons cashews at this step and keep them aside. Then add the chana dal</li>
        <li>Saute the chana dal for 2 to 3 minutes on a low heat or till they turn light golden or golden and add the sliced onions, curry leaves, green chilies and ginger.</li>
        <Li>Sauté the onions till they soften and turn translucent. Stir often while sautéing onions so that they get evenly cooked.</Li>
        <li>Add the turmeric powder and asafoetida (hing). To make it gluten-free use the gluten-free asafoetida or skip it altogether.</li>
        <li>Mix very well and add ½ cup water</li>
        <li>Again mix well and simmer for 2 to 3 minutes or till the mixture thickens a bit.</li>
        <li>Next add the boiled chopped potatoes and mix well.</li>
        <li>Season with salt according to taste. Also add ¼ to ½ teaspoon sugar for a slightly sweet taste. You can add more sugar if you prefer.</li>
        <li>Simmer on a low to medium-low heat for 3 to 4 minutes stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Switch off the heat and then add chopped coriander leaves. Also add fried cashews now (if you have fried the cashews earlier as mentioned in step 5 above). Mix well.</li>
        <li>Stir and keep the potato masala aside. The potato filling should be moist and easily spreadable on the dosa.</li>
        <li>Now lightly stir the batter, before you begin to make dosa. You will also see tiny air pockets in the batter with an increase in its volume.</li>
        <li>eat a cast iron pan or a flat non-stick pan. The pan should be medium hot. Smear some oil if using an iron pan or griddle. Don't smear oil on a non stick pan, as then you won't be able to spread the batter easily.</li>
        <li>Keep the heat to a low, while spreading batter. Spread the batter in a circular way on the pan. On a medium heat, cook the dosa.</li>
        <li>Cook till its base becomes golden and crisp. You can spread the oil which was sprinkled earlier on the dosa with a spoon.</li>
        <li>When you see the base has become golden, the edges have separated from the pan and the dosa has cooked, place a portion of the potato masala filling on the dosa. You can spread the filling a bit if you want.</li>
